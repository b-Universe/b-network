# Project Title: Untitled

### **1. Executive Summary**
"Untitled" is a physics-based, precision building challenge located in a specialized arena on **B**. Players pilot "Happy Ghasts" rigged with mechanical claws to pick up, transport, and arrange oversized objects.

The core gameplay loop moves away from standard grid-based Minecraft placement. Instead, players utilize free-form movement to arrange "funny" furniture and enlarged blocks. The game supports 2, 3, and 4 player mode as well as 2v2 formats, blending cooperative construction with competitive precision.

### **2. Core Mechanics: The Rig**
The primary vehicle for this game is the **Happy Ghast**.

* **Movement:** Players mount the Ghast and have full 3-axis flight control (standard creative flight mechanics applied to the entity).
* **The Claw:** A custom modeled claw machine apparatus hangs from the Ghast via a rope.
* **Interaction:**
    * **The Grip:** The claw engages with items physically. It does not "inventory" items; it physically grabs them.
    * **The Podium:** Each team has a spawn podium where enlarged blocks and custom furniture (couches, stools, lamps, etc.) appear.

### **3. Game Modes**

#### **Mode A: The Stacker (Creative Chaos)**
* **Objective:** Players must stack a series of random, non-uniform custom furniture items.
* **Challenge:** The items have complex shapes (e.g., balancing a lamp on a couch, or, oh no, vise versa).
* **Win Condition:** Create the highest stable structure or stack all given items within the time limit without them toppling over.

#### **Mode B: The Recreater (Precision Replication)**
* **Objective:** A "Ghost Structure" or hologram image is generated in the center of the arena.
* **Gameplay:** Players must identify the correct blocks from their podium, fly them to the build zone, and align them to perfectly match the target image.
* **Challenge:** Requires communication in 2v2 modes (one spotter, one builder, or dual building).

### **4. Scoring System**
Scoring is calculated dynamically based on three factors. Since placement is **not grid-locked**, the system uses high-precision location checks.

1.  **Positional Accuracy (XYZ):** How close is the center of the placed block to the target coordinate?
2.  **Rotational Precision (Yaw/Pitch):** Is the furniture facing the correct direction?
3.  **Time Efficiency:** Bonus points awarded for rapid completion.

> **Note:** "Close enough" counts, but "Perfect" yields maximum points.

### **5. The Finale: Sudden Death**
In the event of a tie, or as a climax to a 2v2 match, the game shifts genres.
- Transition: The construction items despawn.
- Equipment Change: The Happy Ghasts are equipped with Giant Saddlebag Rocket Launchers.
- Mechanic:
  - The game becomes an aerial dogfight.
  - Rockets fire directly at the player's crosshair location.
  - Last team flying wins the bonus multiplier.
6. Scalability & Future Features
- NPC Opponents: Implementation of scripted AI capable of piloting the Ghasts to allow single-player practice or fill empty team slots.
- NPC Teammates: yeah, we're going to make this funny lol
- Arena Varieties: Different maps with obstacles (moving rings, wind tunnels) that make flying the blocks to the build zone more difficult.
